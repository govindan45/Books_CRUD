Book Management API
This project is a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books. The API is developed using Python, leveraging the FastAPI framework, and uses SQLite3 as the database. The API supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and includes functionality for filtering books based on various attributes.
